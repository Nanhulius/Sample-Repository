Hello you-person who is interested in my repo!

These are few of the scripts that I've made for my personal game project.
I update these every now and then as the project moves forward, and they may
drastically change as I learn more about optimization and/or otherwise more
effective/easier ways to approach the code.

Tools that I use in this project are Unity, Visual Studio and gitHub desktop.

Thanks for checking the repo! If you want to reach me, feel free to connect me
in LinkedId and throw me a message: https://www.linkedin.com/in/hannes-sirvi√∂/

Cheers!
